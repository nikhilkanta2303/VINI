          <h1><strong><em>WELCOME</em></strong></h1>
          <br /><em>
            <i>It’s my pleasure to introduce myself as Vineeth Varma. I was born in
            Vishakapatnam and raised in Hyderabad, Telangana. I went to Sri
            Chaitanya School for my education and am presently pursuing my B.Tech at
            IARE. My strength is my willingness to take on new challenges and strive
            for perfection. This is because I believe that learning from our
            successes and failures is the most effective way to shape ourselves in
            order to achieve our objectives. And I believe in myself and my efforts,
            and I seek fulfillment in all aspects of my life. My short-term goal is
            to excel at the skills I’m learning, take on a challenge in some
            outstanding businesses, and climb the way up.</em></p></head></i>
